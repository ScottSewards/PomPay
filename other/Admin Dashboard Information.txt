Admin Dashboard (to create paypal buttons and update analitics)

// new accounts that have a paypal address assigned
// need to create a donation button

- check database for accounts which have paypal address assigned but no button and while loop the results
- have the link to the paypal website where the donate button can be created (maybe use an Iframe)
- display account ID, username and link to forms page
- display form where the donate button code is input and the users account table is updated
(also display account username make everything as clear and easy as possible)
- once the donate button has been created redirect the user back to previous page



// maintaining the paypal analitics for the users
